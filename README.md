Generate random vases based on "2800 Formes de Vases" by Alexandre Sandier

# Concept:
The original work posits that the form of a vase can be generated using 7 different lines, pared with a flat top/bottom.

One of the issues with this is obviously it becomes less feasible to manually draw this the more layers you add, so this aims to fix that

Release goals:
* Able to generate an arbitrary # of layers as svgs
* Allow specific combonations to be tested as csv
